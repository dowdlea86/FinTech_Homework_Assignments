## Overview and Origin ##

Kabbage is a technology company that provides small business with credit lines, efficient payment 
processing solutions and cash flow and data analysis tools.  Kabbage targets small businesses with 
up to US$250,000 in credit and differentiates itself by providing quick approvals versus more 
traditional financial institutions that can take several weeks, if not months, to process and approve facilities.      

Rob Frohwein, Marc Gorline, and Kathryn Petralia founded Kabbage in 2009.  The founders all have 
established background in the FinTech industry and started Kabbage based on their recognition of 
this underserved market segment.  Mr. Frohwein was the CEO of LAVA group, an intellectual property 
and technology investment bank.  Mr. Borline is an entrepreneur who has co-founded other startups 
including Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and the VerticalOne Corporation.  Ms. Petralia has served in 
executive strategy positions at CompuCredit and Revolution Money.   Kabbage has secured over US$2.5B 
in funding in over 16 rounds including from industry giants like Softbank’s Vision Fund.  Very recently 
Kabbage have been acquired by American Express for an undisclosed amount.

## Business Activities ##

The concept for Kabbage is to originate and securitize loans to small businesses.  There are 28 
million small businesses in the US and 40% of these businesses seek funding every year, and 
only a slim majority of them will be approved.  There are several driving factors for this gap.   
The cost to issue a US$5k loan is the same cost associated with a US$5mln loan.  Therefore, the
cost-profits associated with granting a small loan are not worth it for larger lenders.  
Additionally, there is a general a longer processing time at larger institution as systems can be 
very manual and traditional credit checks can take a long time.  Kabbage differentiates itself by 
providing easy access to credit and customers take only 5 minutes to apply, get approval and 
access their credit line.  Kabbage has developed cost efficient machine learning and automation 
technology that enable it to analyze this risk and also streamline payment processing.

Kabbage feels that credit checks and other associated traditional qualification tools are 
outdated.  Instead, Kabbage look primarily at business cash flow and requires access to a 
company’s business bank account and other relevant data channels such as Amazon or PayPal.  
Kabbage runs this information through its algorithm to determine the appropriate eligibility 
rate and fees.  Importantly, there is no human approval required as Kabbage relies solely on its 
system.   While Kabbage also runs credit scores, this usually is a one-off and is not necessarily a 
primary consideration in granting loans.

Kabbage has developed a few adjacent products that complement its core business.  Kabbage 
has developed payment processing technology that makes it easier for customers issue invoices 
and send pay links to customers.  Kabbage allows a small business to link its existing checking 
accounts and generate customizable invoices.  Kabbage also creates a custom pay links so 
business can create a unique URL to accept payments online.  Customers can share this link via 
text, email and the web.  Kabbage also assists customers and uses their data to provide insights 
and expertise.  The easy to use platform allows a user to see all of their accounts, understand 
the data inputs, forecast cash flow so businesses can forecast better and make better decisions.  

In order to further expedite customer access to their loans, Kabbage stands out from other 
lenders by issuing a checking card.  Instead of users requesting funds to their bank accounts 
which can take 1-3 days to process, the Kabbage Card allows users to pay for expenses 
immediately which draw down on the existing established credit line.  This allows small 
business owners the flexibility to pay for unexpected expenses at point of sale terminals, for 
example.  Kabbage also recently has expanded into more traditional banking by offering 
checking accounts that more seamlessly interact with it’s other product offerings and offer competitive rates. 
competitive rates. 

Kababge uses a several different technologies based on it’s various offerings.  For application 
and data services it uses programs like Apache, AngularJS  and jQuery.  Kabbage uses JQuery UI 
to build a more interactive interactions on its user platforms. 

Kababge uses software Google Analytics, Piwik (now Matomo), and Crazy Egg among others to 
track and understand how customers are using it’s websites and app.  Kabbage places a lot of 
emphasis on the ease and quality of it’s user experience and uses Twillo SendGrid to create, 
execute and analyze communication strategies across its channels.

Kabbage uses cloud services from Amazon and Google and in total Kabbage uses over 70 
different technology programs and also has developed its own technology and methods with 10 
patents and 17 trademarks.

## Landscape ##

Kabbage competes in the financial services industry specifically targeting the lending markets 
for small businesses.  Over the last several years there have been several factors that have 
provided an opening for organizations like Kabbage to disrupt the lending markets.  
Importantly, a low interest environment have shrunk margins for large institutional lenders 
reducing profit margins on small business loans.  Innovation and rules-based tools to automate processes and decisions have been an 
accelerating trend in an effort to reduce the costs associated with lending.  Instead of collecting 
a large amount of data and manually inputting various data points like financial statements into 
a system, the disruptors are automatically connecting more relevant data from active sources.  

Traditional organizations have also been reluctant to rely on loan approvals solely based on a 
quantitative model.  These algorithms are becoming more and are getting more complex. 
There is a lot of competition in this space both from traditional lending institutions but also 
from other similar innovative companies that have different business offerings and models.   From the banking sector, Kabbage is competing with business banking groups that primarily 
service customers in a branch network.  Kabbage is experiencing more direct competition from 
FinTech start-ups like BlueVine, OnDeck, Fundbox and Street Shares among many others.  

## Results ##

It is important to note that while Kabbage does have a lot of like for like competition, Kabbage 
has been able to differentiate itself from its peers by having a very fast, easy application 
process and developing a reputation for being extremely convenient.  As Kabbage has further 
developed offerings, it has been able to provide numerous solutions for its customers so that 
these organizations are more likely to continue using it’s products.

There are a few metrics that Kabbage uses to measure its performance.  Kabbage looks at the 
number of customers it has, the amount and size of its loans, and tracks user interactions on its 
platforms.  Kababge has grown significantly over the last 10 yeas and as of end of 3rd quarter 
2019 counts over 200,000 customers.  Significantly, Kabbage added 42,000 new customers in 
the first 3 quarters of 2019 surpassing the 37,000 new customers added in all of 2018.  Kabbage 
was on track to provide customers more than US$2.8bln worth of credit in 2019.  Kabbage’s 
counts more than 75% of its total loans from return customers which shows the sustainability 
of Kabbage’s business model as a long-term value add.   

The business impact of Kabbage and this industry at large has been significant.  By allowing 
small businesses that have not usually had easy access to funding, organizations have been 
more likely to grow and expand their business models which has promoted growth in the 
economy at large.  

COVID-19 dramatically, if not temporarily, altered the landscape for Kabbage as the probability 
of default raised significantly and there was a widely expected contraction in its customer base.  
However, Kabbage was able to leverage its technology and became the second largest lender in 
the governments Paycheck Protection Program as part of the US COVID relief program.   
Kabbage has processed more than US$7bln in PPP loans serving almost 300,000 small business 
and by its calculation has saved 945,000 jobs.

## Recommendations ##

Kabbage has a few areas that it could expand into.  Kabbage currently offers loans shorter than 
18 months but could start expanding and capture slightly larger businesses that require more 
capital and want longer repayment periods.  This could open a different market segment at 
relatively little cost as it’s existing tech may be able to be applied to these new customers at 
smaller costs.    

Very recently, Kabbage has been acquired by American Express.  This goes to show you the 
value of the tech that Kabbage has created as Kabbage and it peers have successfully lowered 
the cost base to provide credit to small businesses.   It also shows you how versatile these Fin 
Tech companies can be as they are more able to provide dynamic solutions that can adapt to 
quickly changing external environments.
